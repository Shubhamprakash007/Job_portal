# Job Portal Website

A job portal website is an online platform that connects job seekers with potential employers. It allows job seekers to:
- Search for job openings
- Create a profile
- Upload their resume
- Apply for jobs

Employers can:
- Post job listings
- Search for candidates
- Manage the hiring process through the website

The goal of a job portal is to make the job search and hiring process more efficient and convenient for both job seekers and employers.
